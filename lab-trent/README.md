#About
This is a single resource API written in NodeJS that uses MongoDB as a database and has user authentication on management endpoints.

#Installation
If you do not have MongoDB installed, go get that set up at http://mongodb.com.

After you have MongoDB up and running, clone the repository and install the dependencies listed in the package file. If you're using NPM as a package manager, you can just navigate to the project directory and use the "npm install" command.

Once you have all the dependencies installed, just run the index file through Node and check http://127.0.0.1:3000 to verify it is online.
